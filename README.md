# pocket-acoustic
Pocket Acoustic is a portable guitar device and app. The small handheld controller acts as a guitar fretboard for your left hand. With the companion app, you can adjust strumming, volume, and pitch, as well as use a built-in synth. The music is played through your phone's speakers. Itâ€™s an all-in-one solution for playing guitar anywhere.
